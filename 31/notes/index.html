      <h3>JavaScript Functions</h3>
      <p>Functions is used to create repeated code. These are some notes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="code">function name() {}</span> - is the way to declare function.</li>
        <li><span class="code">let</span> variables can be visible only inside the function.</li>
        <li>We can call a function in any place in the document. Either before, or after the function declaration.</li>
        <li>We can declare variable in the function and it will be used after we called the function.</li>
        <li>Functions don't support skipping the parameters. But we can add underfined variable as a first parameter.</li>
        <li><span class="code">let variable = function () {}</span> - is the way to create functional expression.</li>
        <li>Function declaration and function expression are differently used by js core. Functional expression can only be called after this expression.</li>
        <li>Anonymous functions that don't have name. They can be used in functional expression.</li>
        <li>IIFE - Immediately invoked function expression. Executes immediately anonymous expression.</li>
        <li>If we create the variable in IIFE with <span class="code">var someVariable = </span>, it will be local, but it will be global if wee declare as  <span class="code">someVariable = </span>.</li>
        <li>We can user arrow functions, they are very handy. <span class="code">let caclulate = (a, b) => a + b;</span> and we will call it as <span class="code">let caclulate(1, 2);</span>.</li>
        <li>Function caan also declarared with new Function() <span class="code">let sayHowdy = new Function('a', 'b', 'return a + b');</span></li>
      </ol>
