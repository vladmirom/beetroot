      <h3>Increments and Decrements</h3>
      <p>Increments are adding somethign to the value. It can be added via <span class="code">let i++</span>. Remember,
        the order of actions of <span class="code">i++</span>:
      <ol class="order-list">
        <li>Console log will show the result of <span class="code">i</span>.</li>
        <li>The increment <span class="code">++</span> will be added and the value will be saved in the memory.</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <p> If we add the increment before the variable: <span class="code">let ++i</span>, the order of actions will bee
        different:
      <ol class="order-list">
        <li>The increment <span class="code">++</span> will be added and the value will be saved in the memory.</li>
        <li>Console log will show the result of <span class="code">i</span>.</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <p>Decrements are deducting somethign from the value. <span class="code">let i--</span>.</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Increments (and decrements) won't work with the text in the strings, will return <span
            class="code">NaN</span>.</li>
        <li>Increments (and decrements) will work with the number in the strings.</li>
        <li>If the variable is empty string, the counter would use it as <span class="code">0</span>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Conditional statements</h3>
      <p>In code <span class="code">+</span> before your vaariable would change the variable to number. <span
          class="code">+prompt('Enter your number')</span> is the same as <span class="code">Number(prompt('Enter your
          number'))</span>
      </p>
      <p>It is not recomended to have more than 2 cheeks in ternary.</p>
      <p>There's a switch case in JS.</p>

      <h3>Loops</h3>
      <p>There are 3 loop types in JS:
      <ol class="order-list">
        <li><span class="code">for</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">while</span></li>
        <li><span class="code">do while</span></li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <p><span class="code">for</span> should have 3 parts: the beginning, the condition, and the step. It can also work
        without the first and the last, however, we need to use it like <span class="code">for(; 1+1;)</span>, where ;
        will represent the missing parts.</p>
      <p>The variable that is declared outside of the loop, and changes in the nested loop can be seen outside of the loops later.</p>
      <p><span class="code">while</span> should have 1 part: the condition, and inside the loop, should have stepper. it's more common to use while with decrement.</p>
      <p><span class="code">do while</span> will execute something at least once. Works similar to while. Used rarely.</p>
