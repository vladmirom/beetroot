      <h3>Why we use React.</h3>
      <p>React creates it's own virtual DOM and makes changes in it first, then it checks the changes in the virtual DOM and after that it uploades changes to the real DOM. This gives us the opportunity to do things faster, or inject the changes to the specific elements in arrays, or objects.</p>
      <p>We can make changes to the specific elements. This means that we don't re-load the whole page, but just a specific changed element, like section, or button.</p>
      <p>Another advantege of React is the easines or creating SPA (Single Page Application).</p>

      <h3>Getting started.</h3>
      <p>Starting the project goes with the command <strong>in the empty folder</strong> in terminal <span class="code">npx create-react-app .</span>.</p>
      <p>If we want to create a subfolder in our folder with the react project, we run the command in our folder, where we want to have a subfolder: <span class="code">npx create-react-app subfolder-name</span>.</p>
      <p>NPX is Node Package Executor - we want to install something just for 1 execution.</p>
      <p>For tests we use <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>.</p>
      <p>To start project we need to use <span class="code">npm start</span> and to run tests <span class="code">npm test</span>. Also we can stop npm with the <span class="code">npm stop</span> command.</p>
      <p>React uses webpack in it's core.</p>

      <h3>Structure.</h3>
      <p><strong>node_modules</strong> - are already set to be in .gitignore.</p>
      <p>React has some files with <span class="code">.pnp</span> or <span class="code">.pnp.js</span>extention, they are are also in gitignore and needed for react.</p>
      <p>The folder <span class="code">/build</span> is the same as we had <span class="code">/dist</span>, where all compiled things are added.</p>
      <p>React also might include .env files.</p>
      <p>Folder <span class="code">/public</span> includes: robots.txt, favicon (can remove or change to my own), manifest for favicon (can remove or change to my own), logo (can remove or change to my own), and index.html (need to change to my own).</p>
      <p>Folder <span class="code">/src</span> includes: all our styles and components.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>File <strong>App.js</strong> is the main file for our application. 
          <ul>
            <li>We import images via <span class="code">import something from './someplace'</span></li>
            <li>We import css via <span class="code">import './App.css'</span>. This is one of the options, we will check more later.</li>
            <li>File <strong>App.css</strong> includes the styles for our front page.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>File <strong>App.test.js</strong> is the file for testing.</li>
        <li>File <strong>setupTests.js</strong> is for testing parameters.</li>
        <li>File <strong>index.js</strong> is entering point for our application. We initialize React, ReactDOM, reportWebVitals, and App from here.</li>
        <li>File <strong>index.css</strong> includes the global styles. Best practices are that this file is removed and the separate file with styles for body, html or tags added.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section section__container">
      <h3>Naming files rules.</h3>
      <p>There are three most popular ways to name the files. The first one is the most popular.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>camelCase - for js files and image, not css. And always PascalCase for components.</li>
        <li>kebab-case - for js files and image, not css. And always PascalCase for components.</li>
        <li>PascalCase - for js files and image, not css. And always PascalCase for components.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If we want to create a subfolder in our folder with the react project, we run the command in our folder, where we want to have a subfolder: <span class="code">npx create-react-app subfolder-name</span>.</p>
      <p>NPX is Node Package Executor - we want to install something just for 1 execution.</p>
