      <h3>Objects</h3>
      <p>Objects can be created with the <strong>Object constructor</strong> or as <strong>Literal object</strong></p>
      <p>Objects have pairs (properties): key and value. Functions in users are called methods.</p>
      <p>We can check if there is key in object using the directive <span class="code">in</span>.</p>
      <p>It is important to access object property by key in for. <span class="code">for (key in user) { (user[key]); }</span>.</p>
      <p>We can clone objects and merge 2 and more objects into one with either <span class="code">for</span> or <span class="code">Object.assign()</span></p>
      <p>There are 4 ways to compare objects:
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Referential equality. We can use <span class="code">===</span>, <span class="code">==</span>, and <span class="code">Object.is()</span>. Will give true only if they are of the same instance (like cloned objects), otherwise - false.</li>
          <li>Manual comparison. Just comparing manually the values of the property of one and another object: <span class="code">object1.name === object2.name</span>.</li>
          <li>Shallow equality. It is a bit similar as a manual comparison, but a bit more complex and using <span class="code">Object.keys()</span>. Checks only 1 level of object properties.</li>
          <li>Deep equity. It is similar to shallow equity, but goes deeper and compares the deeper levels of object properties.</li>
        </ul>

        There is also a trick to compare 2 objects using <span class="code">JSON.stringify()</span>. The idea is to convert objects into strings and compare those.
      </p>
      <p><span class="code">const</span> can be changed with objects.</p>
