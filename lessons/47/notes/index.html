        <h3>Marvel Library.</h3>
        <p><strong>node_modules</strong> - are already set to be in .gitignore.</p>
        <p>React has some files with <span class="notes__code">.pnp</span> or <span class="notes__code">.pnp.js</span>extention, they are are also in gitignore and needed for react.</p>
        <p>The folder <span class="notes__ode">/build</span> is the same as we had <span class="notes__code">/dist</span>, where all compiled things are added.</p>
        <p>React also might include .env files.</p>
        <p>Folder <span class="notes__code">/public</span> includes: robots.txt, favicon (can remove or change to my own), manifest for favicon (can remove or change to my own), logo (can remove or change to my own), and index.html (need to change to my own).</p>
        <p>Folder <span class="notes__code">/src</span> includes: all our styles and components.</p>
        <ul class="notes__unordered-list"> 
          <li>File <strong>App.js</strong> is the main file for our application. 
            <ul>
              <li>We import images via <span class="notes__code">import something from './someplace'</span></li>
              <li>We import css via <span class="notes__code">import './App.css'</span>. This is one of the options, we will check more later.</li>

          <li>File <strong>setupTests.js</strong> is for testing parameters.</li>
          <li>File <strong>index.js</strong> is entering point for our application. We initialize React, ReactDOM, reportWebVitals, and App from here.</li>
          <li>File <strong>index.css</strong> includes the global styles. Best practices are that this file is removed and the separate file with styles for body, html or tags added.</li>
